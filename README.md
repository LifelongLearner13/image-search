# Image Search: AngularJS and Responsive Grid Layout

A simple project to experiment with various CSS layouts using AngularJS partials. Data is pulled from the [flickr.photos.search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) endpoint of the [flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) as a means of simulating different sized content.
